          <p> I've been doing a lot of nerdy stuff lately since I have so much time (no school, no homework, FREEEE). I can't really tell people about this
          though since I hate how pretentious I sound sometimes. But I need a place to put it in case I have free time in the future and I can pull this up
          so I won't spend it doing something dumb. Here it is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This website (duhh)</li>
            <li>Cyberstart challenges</li>
            <li>Working towards more Hackerrank and Freecodecamp certifications, already copped the Web Design one B)</li>
            <li>Learning about backend developing</li>
            <li>Learning python, and eventually C#</li>
            <li>Trying(???) Hackathons, but I suck so it doesn't really count (Also it's hard to find teams since none of my friends are interested)</li>
            <li>Art! ARRGH I missed painting so much! My fam thinks of it as kind of a waste of time, so I never get do it during school days.</li>
            <li>Starting a personal project?? Maybe? Not really confident in that aspect but oh well, I can learn as I go</li>
            <li>Researching college stuff, but it probably doesn't belong here since it's NOT. FUN. >:((((</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p> Anyways. That's it for now. This is only the second break I've spent doing stuff life this, partly because of college apps coming up and partly because the
          pandemic is forcing me to stay at home. A lot of people have pretty much forgotten about it/ got bored of it, because I see all my friends hanging
          out and stuff. I want to as well, but my parents have been working hard to keep us safe, so out of respect for them, I won't. I'm learning a lot more
          on my own anyway. Ok idk how to end this bye</p>
