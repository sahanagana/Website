      <p>My thoughts on the worst school year, probably ever</p>

          <p>First off, just wanted to say that this is probably the last entry on here. I don't enjoy the feel/look of the website and really only did
          it for practice. I'll probably start creating a new one this summer, but I'll keep this one around just for funsies I guess.
          </br>
          As for the topic of my last entry, well what could be more fitting than my junior year coming to a close? I've finished all my AP exams, and 
          am exempted from my finals (thankfully). This school year was insane, from the pandemic to the hurricanes, to the freeze and power outages.
          I think saying I'm exhausted would be an understatement. It probably had something to do with taking school online. 
          Which brings me to my next point: questioning my career... </br>
          I definitely enjoy computer science. Programming and coding was always really appealing to me ever since I started learning it in school.
          But after taking school online for a whole year, I'm not sure how well I can handle sitting at a desk in front of a screen all day.
          Maybe I wouldn't find it so bad if I was with people and not isolated? And I was doing something I liked instead of classes.
