          <p> Ok, my last entry was pretty much a joke because I needed kind of a draft entry to test out all the website animations on.
          But now that I'm finally finished with all the fine tuning and stuff, I might as well start to post actuall...well, you know.
          Stuff. <br> I like computer science. I've heard of people who thought they liked something and realized they didn't but I know
          I like this subject because it's really the only thing in school that I look forward to most of the time (which is weird for me lol).
          I even almost forgot about lunch while finishing one of my labs. I'VE NEVER DONE THAT FOR A CLASS EVER.
          <br> But what I don't like is how competitive everything is. Everyone's so serious about coding and they seem to know so much. I
          see articles about kids younger than me winning google competitions and I get worried. I'm getting into that weird phase where
          everything I do just doesn't seem to be enough. I'm shooting for a fairly competitive college and I don't know if I am good enough.
          My grades aren't stellar. They've been all A's throughout high school, but it's only just this year I've been focused on keeping them
          all 95+. And I've already failed that too, I have a 94 in precal I think. So much for that goal. <br> Sheesh, sorry about that, I
          didn't mean to get all edgy and depressing. I guess my final grades have been getting me down lately, and I just hate this weird 
          sense of semi-stress I keep experiencing. Hopefully my next entry will be a little bit cheerier when I become more refreshed over the break.
          <br> PEACE OUT</p>
