Since my parents are immigrants from India, every few years we travel there to visit family and friends. There are a lot of things that I love about the place, like the amazing food and architecture, as well as an abundance of greenery in the suburbs that is usually absent in the States. However, the place is also unsanitary and can be home to a lot of diseases. A lot of my Indian American friends would get really sick there or upon return, even to the point of hospitalization. </br>

This is where I get to brag about my parents, specifically my mom. I have vague memories from when I was little of her boiling a pot of water for me and my brother to drink. She wouldn't let us eat at the street vendors, despite us begging her. She would make us get all the necessary vaccinations (to our dismay). With her careful planning and preparation we were pretty much the only ones in our group that have returned from India completely healthy, a feat she boasts to this day. </br>

So naturally, in Spring 2020, I trusted her to make the right decisions for our safety, especially since we had at-risk people in the family. Of course, she sprang into action: masks are a must, wipe down groceries, online school until a vaccine come out.  </br>

Anyways, that's why I haven't been to school since March last year. It's been a pretty weird period of time. I picked up a lot of new skills. I even think the experience was worth it to some degree. But would I do it again? HELL NAW </br>

I consider myself an extrovert, and not long after quarantine stopped being an 'extended spring break' did I begin to lose a lot of energy and motivation. I like being around people and would FaceTime and call people as often as I could, usually while doing homework. Alas, this would only last so long. Naturally my friend groups went to school in person sort of reformed and moved on â€” without me. </br>

My response was to pretty much go MIA. I deleted a lot of social media and focused primarily on my schoolwork. My grades benefited greatly, but I don't think *I* did. Obsessing over my work in order to distract myself from a crumbling social life was not a good move. I would get irrationally upset if I got any grade I considered substandard, even more so than I did before. I'd lose sleep over tests and projects. Obviously I was so burnt out by the end of the year that my grades were horrible in the spring. I didn't have the energy to do well anymore, but I was still pretty distressed over my grades. </br>

Okay, I don't want this site to just be me crying over stuff LOL. A lot of good things happened aside from everything. I got better at managing my time and completing my work, I developed new skills like website creation and art (I hit a roadblock with the website and am now procrastinating it but we're not gonna talk about that). I improved my ability to sit down and focus for long periods of time from having to pay attention in online class (much harder said than done). </br>

And here I am. School starts in like, a week? Ish? And oddly enough, I'm so excited. It could be because I want to see my friends in person, or because I'm tired of communicating with teachers only through email. But I think it's mostly because it provides some sort of closure to this whole ordeal, where I can finally leave it in the past and move on to another chapter of my life. </br></p>
