          <p> WOOHOO, my website works! Jeez it took way too long to do that. I guess I got too cocky from having a 100 in computer science because
          I thought I could code a website from scratch no problem. <br> Anyways. This is my first entry. I don't really know what to put here since 
          I was so focused on making the website look and function perfectly that I never thought about what I would do with it. I guess I'll make it
          a diary type thing like Mr. Wang, and upload any projects I do every now and then. That way, once I apply for college, I can take out all the 
          stupid stuff and just have my code on there and it'll be super impressive. BAM 6 figure job, crazy stacked, mansions and sports cars, NFL/NBA boyfriend, no problem. <br>
          Anyway, that's all I have to say for now. I am going to delete this later, or maybe make it sound more smart in case a college admission person or future
          employer cares to read it. But for now, no one will so I can put all the stupid stuff I want. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadlskgjagkjaldkjfagaowij;oaerg;rj;ajljal;jfsd;lj;aldjfakj. Ok cool goodbye for now.</p>
